import UIKit


//: ## Q1: Optionals
class Words {
    var wordA : String!
    var wordB : String!
    
    init (wordA: String?, wordB: String?) {
        self.wordA = wordA
        self.wordB = wordB
    }

//: ### Are the values passed in to the **init** function and those set to the instance
//: ### variables the same type? If not, why?


//: No, because the values passed into the init function can be nil but those set to the instance variables cannot be.


//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
    class func arePalindromes(words: [String]) -> Bool {
        let reversedWords = words.map() {String($0.characters.reverse())}
        let numElements = words.count
        
        for var i = 0; i < numElements; i++ {
            if words[i] != reversedWords[i] {
                return false
            }
        }
        return true
    }
//: ### Why does the compiler dislike the **for loop**? Fix it.
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: The for loop does not like using let for i since i is a variable that is constantly changing. The function needs to return true after the for loop is finished executing. The variable numElements is never mutated so we can just declare it using let. We need to make the function arePalindromes a class function so that the class Words can call this function.


//: ## Q3: More Functions and Object Initialization
    func isAnagram() -> Bool {
        var countLetters = [Character : Int]() //Line X
        let lenA = self.wordA.characters.count
        let lenB = self.wordB.characters.count
        
        if lenA != lenB {
            return false
        }
        
        var arrA = Array(self.wordA.characters)
        var arrB = Array(self.wordB.characters)
        
        for i in 0...lenA-1 {
            let letter = arrA[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] { //Line Y
                countLetters[letter] = val + 1
            } else {
                countLetters[letter] = 1
            }
        }
        
        for i in 0...lenB-1 {
            let letter = arrB[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val - 1
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        for (_, count) in countLetters {
            if count != 0 {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        return true
    }
//: ### What is the problem with declaring **countLetters** as we do in **Line X**,
//: ### and then using it in **Line Y**? Fix it (by only changing **Line X**).
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: Line x does not have the correct syntax for declaring countLetters and it was setting countLetters to nil. Return nil at the bottom should be return true. The function isAnagram() cannot be a class function since it is accessing instance variables.
